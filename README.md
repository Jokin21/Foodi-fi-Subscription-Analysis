# Foodi-fi-Subscription-Analysis

The aim of this project is to analyze Foodifi's subscription data using SQL. Foodifi is a meal delivery service that offers subscription plans to its customers. 
The company wants to gain insights into the subscription patterns of its customers and identify any trends that can help improve its business model.

In the initial stage, the data will be imported into a SQL database and cleaned. The data will be organized into tables, such as customer information, subscription plans,
and order details. Once the data is cleaned and organized, various SQL queries will be run to extract insights from the data.

The project will include the following analyses:

Customer retention: A query that shows the percentage of customers who renew their subscription after the first month. 
This will help identify the subscription plans that have the highest retention rate.

Subscription plan analysis: A query that shows the number of customers subscribed to each plan and the revenue generated from each plan. 
This will help identify the most popular subscription plans and the plans that generate the most revenue.

Order frequency analysis: A query that shows the average number of orders placed by customers per month. This will help identify any patterns in customer behavior 
and order frequency.

Customer demographics: A query that shows the demographics of Foodifi's customers, such as age, gender, and location. This will help identify any trends in
customer demographics that can help improve marketing efforts.

The insights gained from the analysis will be presented in a report format, highlighting the key findings and recommendations. 
The report will include the SQL queries used to extract the data, as well as a narrative explaining the insights derived from the analysis.

Overall, the project will provide Foodifi with insights into its subscription patterns and customer behavior. 
It will also help identify areas where improvements can be made to improve customer retention and revenue generation.
The project will demonstrate the importance of data analysis and SQL queries in gaining insights from large datasets.
